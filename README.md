BDD and Cucumber

Learning Goals
--------------
Create user stories to describe a feature of a 
SaaS app, use the Cucumber tool to turn those stories into executable 
acceptance tests, and run the tests against your SaaS app.  


**Part 1: Create a declarative scenario step for adding movies**

The goal of BDD is to express behavioral tasks rather than low-level operations.  

SUCCESS is when all Background steps for the scenarios in
`filter_movie_list.feature` and `sort_movie_list.feature` are passing
Green. 

**Part 2: Happy paths for filtering movies**

Complete the scenario `restrict to movies with `PG` or `R` ratings` in `filter_movie_list.feature`. 


**Part 3: Happy paths for sorting movies by title and by release date**


Acceptance-Unit Test Cycle

Learning Goals
--------------
* Create and run simple Cucumber scenarios to test a new feature
* Use RSpec to create unit tests that drive the creation of app code that lets the Cucumber scenario pass
* Understand where to modify a Rails app to implement the various parts of a new feature, since a new feature often touches the database schema, model(s), view(s), and controller(s)
